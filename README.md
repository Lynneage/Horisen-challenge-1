# Code Refactor Starter Code
Things i did to refactor code



## 1.css condensed push
my first git push to gitlab condensed all the repaeting css to shorten and clean the styles. i did this by putting all similar describers in corresponding classes

## 2.html sematics and css names updated 
i renamed the earlier condensed names to desriptive names to better find and describe which css styles go to which html divs. As far as the divs go i renamed the dives to better show what section of the page they went to

## 3. alt attributes added
my alt attributes were just descriptions i added to each individual image to show what image held what 

## side note
i updated the title at the start of it without Realizing it was part of the project and fixed the link simply because it was straight foward and easy
